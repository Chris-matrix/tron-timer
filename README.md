```

### Key Components and Code Snippets

#### Advanced Timer Component
The core timer functionality uses requestAnimationFrame for high-precision timing and handles interruptions when the user switches tabs or minimizes the browser:

```javascript
// High-precision timer using requestAnimationFrame
class PrecisionTimer {
  constructor(callback, interval) {
    this.callback = callback;
    this.interval = interval;
    this.rafId = null;
    this.isRunning = false;
    this.isPaused = false;
    this.startTime = 0;
    this._wasInterrupted = false;
    
    // Bind methods
    this.tick = this.tick.bind(this);
    this.handleVisibilityChange = this.handleVisibilityChange.bind(this);
    
    // Set up visibility change detection
    if (typeof document !== 'undefined') {
      document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', this.handleVisibilityChange);
    }
  }
  
  start() {
    if (this.isRunning) return;
    
    this.isRunning = true;
    this.isPaused = false;
    this._wasInterrupted = false;
    this.startTime = performance.now();
    this.lastTimestamp = this.startTime;
    
    // Begin animation frame loop
    this.rafId = requestAnimationFrame(this.tick);
  }
  
  tick(timestamp) {
    if (!this.isRunning || this.isPaused) return;
    
    const deltaTime = timestamp - this.lastTimestamp;
    
    // Only call callback if enough time has passed
    if (deltaTime >= this.interval) {
      this.callback();
      this.lastTimestamp = timestamp;
    }
    
    // Continue the loop
    this.rafId = requestAnimationFrame(this.tick);
  }
  
  handleVisibilityChange() {
    if (document.visibilityState === 'hidden') {
      // User switched tabs or minimized browser
      if (this.isRunning && !this.isPaused) {
        this._wasInterrupted = true;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Other methods: pause, resume, stop, reset, wasInterrupted
}

// Usage in Timer.jsx component
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = TimerManager.createCountdownTimer({
    duration: timeLeft,
    onTick: (remaining) => {
      setTimeLeft(remaining);
    },
    onComplete: handleTimerComplete,
    onInterruption: handleInterruption
  });
  
  timerRef.current = timer;
  
  if (isActive && !isPaused) {
    timer.start();
  }
  
  return () => {
    timer.destroy();
  };
}, []);
```

#### Achievement System
The achievement system tracks user progress and unlocks achievements when conditions are met:

```javascript
// Achievement checking logic in AchievementContext.jsx
const checkAchievements = useCallback(() => {
  if (!focusData) return;
  
  const newUnlocked = [];
  
  // Check Focus Master achievements (based on total focus time)
  const totalFocusHours = (focusData.totalFocusTime || 0) / 60; // Convert minutes to hours
  checkAchievementType('focusMaster', totalFocusHours, newUnlocked);
  
  // Check Streak Champion achievements (based on current streak)
  const currentStreak = focusData.streaks?.current || 0;
  checkAchievementType('streakChampion', currentStreak, newUnlocked);
  
  // Check Focus Ninja achievements (based on uninterrupted sessions)
  const uninterruptedSessions = focusData.uninterruptedSessions || 0;
  checkAchievementType('focusNinja', uninterruptedSessions, newUnlocked);
  
  // If new achievements were unlocked, update state and show notifications
  if (newUnlocked.length > 0) {
    setAchievements(prev => ({
      unlocked: [...prev.unlocked, ...newUnlocked],
      recent: [...newUnlocked, ...prev.recent].slice(0, 5),
      notifications: [...newUnlocked, ...prev.notifications]
    }));
    
    // Show notifications for each unlocked achievement
    newUnlocked.forEach(achievement => {
      showAchievementNotification(achievement);
    });
  }
}, [focusData, checkAchievementType, showAchievementNotification]);
```

#### Enhanced Storage System
The application uses an enhanced localStorage system with versioning and error handling:

```javascript
// StorageManager.js - Robust local storage with versioning
const setItem = (key, data) => {
  if (!isStorageAvailable()) {
    console.error('localStorage is not available');
    return false;
  }
  
  try {
    // Convert data to string
    const serializedData = JSON.stringify(data);
    
    // Check if there's enough space
    if (!hasEnoughSpace(key, serializedData)) {
      console.error('Not enough localStorage space');
      // Dispatch storage limit event
      if (isBrowser) {
        const event = createCustomEvent('storage-limit-reached', { 
          key, 
          size: getStringSize(serializedData) 
        });
        if (event) window.dispatchEvent(event);
      }
      return false;
    }
    
    // Store the data
    localStorage.setItem(key, serializedData);
    
    // Update version
    setDataVersion(key, CURRENT_VERSION);
    
    // Broadcast change to other tabs
    if (isBrowser) {
      const event = createCustomEvent('storage-updated', { 
        key, 
        data, 
        version: CURRENT_VERSION 
      });
      if (event) window.dispatchEvent(event);
    }
    
    return true;
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(`Error storing data for key ${key}:`, e);
    return false;
  }
};
```

#### Data Visualization
The analytics dashboard provides interactive visualizations of focus data:

```jsx
// FocusChart.jsx - Component for visualizing focus time trends
const FocusChart = ({ timeRange, dateRange }) => {
  const { getSessionsForDateRange } = useData();
  
  const sessions = getSessionsForDateRange(dateRange?.startDate, dateRange?.endDate) || [];
  const chartData = prepareChartData(sessions, timeRange, dateRange);
  
  return (
    <ChartContainer>
      <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height="100%">
        <BarChart
          data={chartData}
          margin={{ top: 20, right: 30, left: 20, bottom: 30 }}
        >
          <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" stroke="rgba(255,255,255,0.1)" />
          <XAxis 
            dataKey="time" 
            stroke="#00f6ff"
            tick={{ fill: '#ffffff' }}
          />
          <YAxis 
            stroke="#00f6ff"
            tick={{ fill: '#ffffff' }}
            label={{ 
              value: 'Minutes', 
              angle: -90, 
              position: 'insideLeft',
              fill: '#ffffff'
            }}
          />
          <Tooltip content={renderTooltip} />
          <Legend />
          <Bar 
            dataKey="completed" 
            name="Completed" 
            stackId="a" 
            fill="#00ff9d" 
            radius={[4, 4, 0, 0]}
          />
          <Bar 
            dataKey="incomplete" 
            name="Incomplete" 
            stackId="a" 
            fill="#ff3864" 
            radius={[4, 4, 0, 0]}
          />
        </BarChart>
      </ResponsiveContainer>
    </ChartContainer>
  );
};
```

### Notification System
The application uses a centralized notification system that handles both in-app and browser notifications:

```javascript
// NotificationManager.js - Unified notification utility
const notify = async (message, options = {}) => {
  const {
    title = 'TRON Focus Timer',
    sound = null,
    showBrowser = true,
    showInApp = true,
    icon = '/favicon.ico',
    ...otherOptions
  } = options;
  
  const results = {
    browser: null,
    sound: null,
    inApp: null
  };
  
  // Handle browser notification
  if (showBrowser) {
    try {
      results.browser = await showBrowserNotification(title, {
        body: message,
        icon,
        ...otherOptions
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Browser notification failed:', error);
      results.browser = { error };
    }
  }
  
  // Handle sound
  if (sound) {
    try {
      results.sound = await playSound(sound);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Sound notification failed:', error);
      results.sound = { error };
    }
  }
  
  // Handle in-app notification
  if (showInApp) {
    results.inApp = { message, title, ...otherOptions };
  }
  
  return results;
};
```

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Challenges

1. **Accurate Timer Implementation**: Creating a drift-free timer that works consistently across browser states was challenging. The solution involved using requestAnimationFrame with timestamp comparison for better accuracy, implementing the Page Visibility API for detecting background tabs, and adding recovery mechanisms for browser refreshes.

2. **State Management Complexity**: Managing the interrelated state between timer, achievements, and analytics required careful design. The solution involved creating a well-structured context hierarchy, implementing memoization for expensive calculations, and using a versioned storage system to ensure data integrity.

3. **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Ensuring consistent data across multiple tabs was difficult due to localStorage limitations. The solution involved creating a custom event system to broadcast changes between tabs and implementing a robust storage manager with conflict resolution.

### What Went Well

- The component-based architecture made the application highly maintainable
- The context API provided an elegant solution for state management without external libraries
- The themed styling system allowed for consistent visual design with easy customization
